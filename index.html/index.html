 	<h1>About Me</h1>

 	<p>Hi there! My name is Brooke. I am a mom to a 1 year old tiny human and 3 cats. I love traveling, hiking, and birdwatching. You will rarely see me without coffee. I  <font size=4><strong>Love</strong></font> coffee!</p>

 	<p>I grew up in northeast Ohio (Youngstown area). In 2014, I graduated from Hiram College with a b.a. in biology. A few months after graduation, I moved across the country with my better half to southern California. While in San Diego, I eventually found work as a wildlife technician. Although we loved California living, we found our way back to Ohio before our son was born in April 2016. That was the beginning of my favorite adventure. Now - just a few months after his 1st birthday - I am starting this coding bootcamp and I am very excited! </p>
